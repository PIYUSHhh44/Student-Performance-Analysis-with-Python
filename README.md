# Student-Performance-Analysis-with-Python

## Overview
This project analyzes the "Student Scores Dataset" from Kaggle, aiming to uncover insights into factors affecting student academic performance. Using Python's powerful data analysis libraries, we delve into key patterns and trends.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used visualizations and statistical techniques to understand the data.
- **Key Visualizations**:
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: Showed relationships between features and scores.
  - **Distribution Charts**: Highlighted score patterns and outliers.
  - **Trend Analysis**: Investigated how study habits and demographics correlate with performance.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Student scores across subjects.
- Features like study hours, demographics, and other related factors.

**Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com)

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For creating insightful visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## Visualizations
1. **Correlation Heatmap**:  
   - Showcases relationships between different variables.
   - Helps identify factors strongly correlated with student scores.

2. **Score Distributions**:  
   - Analyzes patterns and potential outliers in score data.

3. **Performance Trends**:  
   - Explores how specific factors (e.g., study hours) affect scores.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-analysis.git


## File Structure
   - **Python_Project1.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook with the analysis and visualizations.
   - **Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv**: The dataset used in the analysis.
   - **README.md**: Documentation for the repository.

## Insights
   - **High Correlation Features**: Found features strongly correlated with academic success.
   - **Study Patterns**: Analyzed trends such as the impact of study hours on scores.
   - **Demographic Analysis**: Explored differences in performance across demographic groups.

## Future Work
   - Expand the analysis with machine learning models to predict scores.
   - Add interactive visualizations using tools like Plotly.
